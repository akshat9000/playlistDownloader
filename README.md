# playlistDownloader
A simple python script which enables you to download multiple videos of a playlist, either manually created or pre-made
__

## Aim
I aim to create a python script which works in tandem with a txt file located in the same directory, which contains a list of urls
This will be different from the other downloaders which exist as the user will have the option of either simply creating a list of videos to download by copying its urls onto the txt file, or just copying the url of the first video of a pre-existing playlist, and the script will do the rest
__

## How to use?
This script is fairly simple to use
Just download the python file along with the urls.txt file to a location of your choice on you machine
list all the urls you require to be downloaded
open up a terminal instance, navigate to the folder where you have kept this file, and simply execute the python script

*Note: This is **NOT** the headless version, that is soon to follow, meanwhile, you can choose to minimize the window that pops up, or watch it download*
